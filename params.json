{"name":"Coding Exercises","tagline":"Software Kata","body":"Coding Exercises  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/karlmutch/CodingExercises.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/karlmutch/CodingExercises)\r\n================\r\n\r\nIn response to job interview questions and interesting code challenges, a set of Java 8 classes, and their Cucumber based tests.\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n----------\r\n\r\nDuring a recent full time job assignment several projects were wound down due to redundancy within our product offerings.  Being given good notice people spent large amounts of time reading coding interview books and visiting various web sites to learn skills that they never exercised within their respective roles and probably would completely forget until the next occasion of job hunting.\r\n\r\nSo, to give me a good place to store code examples that others can read and to have a place to store working examples of code that are interesting I offer the following coding examples, or Kata.\r\n\r\nChecking of parameters is suspended due to most whiteboard examples not having the space to check for null's, empty parameters and the like.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nThere are 30 plus examples available so looking at them all is probably not practical.  Choose some that are small enough or some that are interesting enough to warrant a look at.\r\n\r\n#### Recent Additions\r\n\r\n* [Distributed Top-K example]\r\n(https://github.com/karlmutch/CodingExercises/blob/master/src/main/java/com/karlmutch/DistributedTopK.java?ts=4)\r\n\r\n### A selection of what is available\r\n\r\n* [Recursive string reversal] (https://github.com/karlmutch/CodingExercises/blob/master/src/main/java/com/karlmutch/OnlyInAnInterviewStrings.java?ts=4)\r\n* [A queue implemented using 2 stacks] (https://github.com/karlmutch/CodingExercises/blob/master/src/main/java/com/karlmutch/QueueBasedStack.java?ts=4)\r\n* [Simple B-Tree style class with traversals] (https://github.com/karlmutch/CodingExercises/blob/master/src/main/java/com/karlmutch/SearchTree.java?ts=4)\r\n* [LRU Caching without using Guava, JDK cache style classes etc] (https://github.com/karlmutch/CodingExercises/blob/master/src/main/java/com/karlmutch/LRUCacheLinkedHashMap.java?ts=4)\r\n* [Count the digit '1' in a number] (https://github.com/karlmutch/CodingExercises/blob/master/src/main/java/com/karlmutch/CountOnes.java?ts=4)\r\n* [Fibonacci numer series generator using Eigenvalues]\r\n(https://github.com/karlmutch/CodingExercises/blob/master/src/main/java/com/karlmutch/EigenvalueFibonacci.java?ts=4)\r\n* [Fibonacci numer series generator using Memoization]\r\n(https://github.com/karlmutch/CodingExercises/blob/master/src/main/java/com/karlmutch/LookasideFibonacci.java?ts=4)\r\n* [Insertion sorting - unoptimized, and optimized (3-4x faster)]\r\n(https://github.com/karlmutch/CodingExercises/blob/master/src/main/java/com/karlmutch/InsertionSort.java?ts=4)\r\n\r\nNew examples are being added on a semi regular basis.\r\n\r\nCompilation\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nA maven pom file is provided with a small set of Cucumber JVM tests implemented for many of the examples.","google":"UA-64020500-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
