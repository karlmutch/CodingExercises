Coding Exercises
================

A set of classes typical of job interviews and solutions.  Interview coding questions on Whiteboards are often fraught with assumptions and perform very poorly as predictors of success for employees.

During my most recent job we have had several projects close due to redundancy within our product offerings.  Being given good notice people spent large amounts of time reading coding interview books and visiting various web sites to learn skills that they never exercised within their respective roles and probably would completely forget until the next occasion of job hunting.

All, both good and fair performers, ended up looking like stellar heros when subjected to job interviews that did little to actually differentiate them from each other.

During this period I did myself attend an interview where I offered to do a coding exercise, if the interviewer desired, of greatly complexity than a 1/2 hour on a whitebroad would allow in the days after the interview.  I was met with the comment 'But you will just use the online resources available', followed by by a few seconds silence then the interview turned to me with a furowed brow and admitted, 'just like I do everyday'.

I suspect doing well at coding exercises on a whiteboard is probably an inverse indicator of job preformance because the person doing well at it simply has not been doing the other things that really count in their job role.

So, to save time, allow me to do my day job, and avoid the often pointless task of being asked to do things like coding a prime number finder on a whiteboard I offer the following coding examples.


Recursive string reversal
A queue implemented using 2 stacks
Simple B-Tree style class with traversals
LRU Caching without using Guava, JDK cache style classes etc
Count the digit n in a number

I will add others as I discover the common cases.
